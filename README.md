This repository is associated with the manuscript titled: "The eye that guards the rock: does it shape the world? Nest site attendance patterns in a pelagic seabird, the little auk"
It is aimed to be submitted to a scientific journal (e.g. Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology) by the end of September, currently being reviewed by co-authors.

In this study, patterns of nest site attendance in male and female of the little auk throughout the entire breeding season were investigated in the context of quite ancient Williams' hypothesis
The hypothesis has been suggested to explain male-parental care in fish, here is used to explain a transition from biparental to and male-only care as it is observed in the little auk.
Data of failed breeders nest site attendance was also considered, to disentable the relative contributions of parental investment and territoriality. 

The repositorium provides all the data used in the study (three .rds files) and the script with these data analysis. Specific reseach questions, methodology and results as well as all the scientific backgournd and the discussion provided in the text of the manuscript - for now beyond the repo; to be linked when published.
