# The eye that guards the rock: does it shape the world? Nest site attendance patterns in a colonially breeding pelagic seabird

This repository is associated with the manuscript titled: "The eye that guards the rock: does it shape the world? Nest site attendance patterns in a pelagic seabird, the little auk"
It is now submitted to a scientific journal: Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology, being considered for publication.

In this study, patterns of nest site attendance in male and female of the little auk throughout the entire breeding season were investigated in the context of quite ancient Williams' hypothesis
The hypothesis has been suggested to explain male-parental care in fish, here is used to explain a transition from biparental to and male-only care as it is observed in the little auk.
Data of failed breeders nest site attendance was also considered, to disablement the relative contributions of parental investment and territoriality. 

The repository provides all the data used in the study (three .xlsx files, and their .rds equivalent) and the script with these data analysis. 
Specific research questions, methodology and results as well as all the scientific background and the discussion provided in the text of the manuscript - for now beyond the repo; to be linked when published.
